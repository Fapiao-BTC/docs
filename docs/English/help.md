# Fapiao for BTC

Let’s get started quickly with this protocol in 5 minutes

## what is it?

You may have heard of **Inscribe, Runes** or **BTCL2**

I don't think **Fp belongs to any of the above** but **it can achieve any of the above**

### Development background

- In March 2023, [Ordinals](#) appeared out of thin air:
   - Defines a set of ordinal protocols that run on the Bitcoin network, enabling Tokens and NFTs to be implemented and run stably on the Bitcoin network
- In May 2023, with the emergence of [Unisat](#), [MagicEden](#) and other inscription trading platforms, a prosperous Bitcoin ecosystem will be brought about in a very short time

Although these protocols do implement the Token mechanism in BTC, they do not allow developers to program independently.

Out of curiosity and interest, I looked up the relevant implementation principles, and then suddenly thought, why not imitate the relevant implementation principles so that developers can program themselves?

So **Fapiao was born**

## What can it do?

Implement anything you want, just like Ethereum’s **smart contracts**

The difference is programming using **JavaScript**

This is a simple contract example:
```javascript
/*
Generate a simple contract template.
Note: You should not have constructors
*/
class Contract {
	
     init(){
        
     }
	
}
```
:::caution
- The name of the entry class must be Contract
- You should not implement constructor in entry class
- The init function must exist, whether you encode it in the function body or not
