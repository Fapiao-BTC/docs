# Quickly create KFC20 tokens

**We have a KFC20 template built into the protocol. You can quickly create your token by inheriting the KFC20 class**


**You can also complete the business logic you want by rewriting KFC20 functions**

```javascript
class Contract extends KFC20{

     init() {
         this._name = 'KFC20';
         this._symbol = 'K2';
         this._totalSupply = SafeMath.val(100000000);
         this._balances.setBucket(this._msgSender(), this._totalSupply);
         this.event({
             name: 'Transfer',
             from: 'fapiao.org',
             to: this._msgSender(),
             amount: this._totalSupply
         });
     }

}
```
